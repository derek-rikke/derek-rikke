# 👋 Hi, I’m Derek Rikke

💼 I’m a data analyst based in Colorado, currently working as a Data Annotator and AI Evaluator at DataAnnotation.tech.

👀 My interests include data analysis, reporting, and building tools that make insights actionable. In my current role, I design data-driven evaluation tasks, annotate structured outputs, and perform quality control to improve AI and data systems. Much of this work overlaps with typical analyst responsibilities: defining data requirements, generating insights from complex outputs, and collaborating on process improvements.

📊 My toolkit includes SQL, Python, Tableau, and Google Sheets. I’m skilled in querying, wrangling, and visualizing data to uncover trends and support decision-making.

🌱 Recent projects include:

- **[Exploring Data in Foster Care](https://github.com/derek-rikke/exploring_data_in_foster_care)**  
  Analyzed foster care placement data to highlight bottlenecks and placement times.

- **[Predicting Car Prices with Machine Learning](https://github.com/lordegraves/predictingCarPrices)**  
  Built regression models to predict used car prices and identify key pricing factors.

- **[AI Boot Camp RAG Agent](https://github.com/lordegraves/final_project_bootcamp)**  
  Created a Retrieval-Augmented Generation agent to surface relevant information from unstructured data.
